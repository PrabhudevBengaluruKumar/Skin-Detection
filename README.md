# Skin-Detection
Classification project to predict skin material vs non skin material 

1. The main objective of this project is to train different classifiers that can predict skin vs non-skin material. Performance of different classifiers are compared and evaluated using appropriate metrics.
2. At first raw input data is cleaned, and dimensionality of the data is reduced with the help of Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Then it is fed to the classifiers to perform skin detection.
